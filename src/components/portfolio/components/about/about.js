      <p>
        I'm a software developer from Melbourne, Australia, who enjoys
        travelling to new cities (when there's no pandemic), and following new
        developments in the space industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm interested in full-stack development, with frontend experience
        working in HTML/CSS, JavaScript and React, as well as backend
        development in Node.js on my personal projects. I also have experience
        using AWS to deploy projects through CodePipeline and Elastic Beanstalk.
